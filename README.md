Overview
-------
This library is able to show a pdf file inside of a View.

It is a effort to merge the great [subsampling-scale-image-view] with our
[subsampling-pdf-decoder] to achieve a more developer friendly view to handle pdfs.


Usage
-------
This library needs version 21 (Lollipop) or above to render the pdf.

    compile 'de.number42:pdfview:0.1.0@aar'
}
```
